## 100 - About the Container registry

The Container registry stores container images within your organization or personal account, and allows you to associate an image with a repository. You can choose whether to inherit permissions from a repository, or set granular permissions independently of a repository. You can also access public container images anonymously.

## 200 - About Container registry support

The Container registry currently supports the following container image formats:

- [Docker Image Manifest V2, Schema 2](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/manifest-v2-2/)
- [Open Container Initiative (OCI) Specifications](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec)

When installing or publishing a Docker image, the Container registry supports foreign layers, such as Windows images.
