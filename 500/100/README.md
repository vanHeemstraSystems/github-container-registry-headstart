# 100 - Limits for published npm versions

If you publish over 1,000 npm package versions to GitHub Packages, you may see performance issues and timeouts occur during usage.

In the future, to improve performance of the service, you won't be able to publish more than 1,000 versions of a package on GitHub. Any versions published before hitting this limit will still be readable.

If you reach this limit, consider deleting package versions or contact Support for help. When this limit is enforced, our documentation will be updated with a way to work around this limit. For more information, see "[Deleting and restoring a package](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/deleting-and-restoring-a-package)" or "[Contacting Support](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/learn-github-packages/about-github-packages#contacting-support)."
